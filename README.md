# ⚙️ How It Works

**Default: push-to-talk.** Hold **Right Ctrl** (or **F9**), speak, release. Maya transcribes only that recording, so room noise is ignored. Change it with the `MAYA_PTT_KEY` environment variable: a comma-separated list such as `right ctrl,f9` (`mouse:x2` / `mouse:x` use mouse side buttons if your mouse reports them; anything else is a keyboard key like `f8`).

**Wake-word mode:** set `MAYA_MODE=wake` and use the steps below.

1. Launch Maya AI.
2. The startup animation will appear.
3. Maya activates the microphone.
4. Say **"Maya"** to wake the assistant.
5. Maya replies **"Yes Boss"**.
6. Speak your command.
7. Maya processes and executes your request.

---

# 💬 Example

```
You: Maya

Maya: Yes Boss

You: Open Chrome

Maya: Opening Chrome
```

---

# ⚠️ Notes

- The startup GIF animation is off by default. Set `MAYA_ANIMATION=1` to show it.
- Spoken answers are kept short (about two sentences). Tune with the `MAYA_MAX_TOKENS` environment variable (default 100).
- Works on **Windows** and **macOS**. Safari is macOS-only; on Windows it is skipped.
- Microphone capture uses `sounddevice`, so PyAudio / C++ build tools are not needed.
- Ollama must be installed for AI chat functionality.
- Make sure your microphone permission is enabled.
